# 457-Onion-Router
Usage: python awget.py <URL> [-c chainfile]
Usage: python ss.py [-p port]

The project works as intended.

Run ss.py on the machines in the chaingang.txt file first, then start awget.py on the machine you would like to receive the file. If chaingang.txt or the given chainfile does not exit, an error will be given and the program will quit. 

URL must start with either http:// or https://.

Each SS should run in a different directory on a different machine.

If no port is given, a SS will run on port 5000
