# 457-Onion-Router
Usage: awget <URL> [-c chainfile]

The project works as intended.

Run ss.py on the machines in the chaingang.txt file first, then start awget.py on the machine you would like to receive the file. If chaingang.txt or the given chainfile does not exit, an error will be given and the program will quit.
